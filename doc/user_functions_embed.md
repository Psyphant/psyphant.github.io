It is possible to embed streams of Communote topics into any website. Therefor you have to copy and paste a special embed code (a JavaScript snippet) into the HTML code of your website.
Even in embedded topic streams you can write, comment and like messages - as easy as you already know it from the regular Communote. The embed code can be reached from the actions menu of the stream.
