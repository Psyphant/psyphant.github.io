# 2 Functions

## 2.1 Register to Communote

In order to register to a Communote Microblog with free access, you only need to type in your email address in the Register form (see Figure "Login & Registration"). You will then receive an e-mail with an automatically generated link that closes off the registration.

![](/images/docu/registration.png)

_Figure "Login & Registration"_

Your Communote system may not be open to all users. In that case you do not receive an e-mail right away, but your registration has to be confirmed by an admin of the system before you can start using Communote.

## 2.2 Write Notes

Using Comunote you can quickly and easily write notes, messages or protocols. You are thereby not - unlike other microblogging services - limited to a number of letters. You can add easy formats to your note and attach any kind of data to it. Pictures with the formats JPG, PNG or GIF will automatically be transformed into a preview within the note. It is possible to attach a video-link from YouTube or Vimeo, witch will be embed into Communote. You can also notify your colleagues using @mentions.

### 2.2.1 The Editor

If you want to write a new note, you will always find a small editor field above the list of notes. When you click in that field, it will change into the note editor that we have already shown you in Chapter 2. Now you can start writing right away. You can add easy formatting options like **bold**, _italic_ or <u>underlined</u> to your message.

The editor has further options for your message ("Topic", "People", "Tags" and "Attachments") that will help you add additional information and content to your note. Those options are not mandatory and can be used on demand. If you choose one of those options, a new input field will appear in which you can add the information.

![](/images/docu/editor.png)

_Figure "Editor"_

#### 2.2.1.1 Topics

Within Communote notes are always **specific to a topic**, meaning that before sending a note in, you have to decide in which topic the note will be saved in. Communote makes that selection easier for you by choosing the topic that you have selected by default. If you don't have the rights to write into a topic or if you are in the general message view, a default topic will be chosen for your note by default. You can always change that default option or add more topics to the selection. A new function of version 3.0 is that you can write into a different topic from the one that you are currently reading.

In order for the note to be posted, at least one topic has to be chosen. You can use the "send"-button or the combination Ctrl + Enter to send the message.

![](/images/docu/editor_choose_topic.png)

_Figure "Choose topic in editor"_

#### 2.2.1.2 Tags

Tags have the purpose to structure Communote and make the search for content easier. There are two ways that can be used to insert tags into a note: Firstly they can simply be added into the note with a hashtag (#) before the tag and secondly they can be added with the option "Tags" below the editor (see "Using tags in the editor").

While you are still typing, Communote already suggests tags that have been used in Communote before. You can either user one of the suggestions or overwrite them and add a new tag to the system. If you don't need the suggestions, you can easily blend out the list with the Esc key. You can also blend them out permanently for all future messages in the menu of the editor (the gear on the right hand's side of the editor).

![](/images/docu/editor_inline_tag.png)

_Figure "Using tags in the editor"_

#### 2.2.1.3 Attachments

Communote offers the possibility of adding attachments to the note and sharing them with other users. The standard configuration limits the data size to 10 MB. Please contact your Administrator, if you would like to know the exact size limit of the attachments.

You can add an attachment to your note by chosing the option "attachments" below the editor. You can now choose a file from your computer and add it to your note. Before sending in your note, you can re-check the attachment and erase it if that's necessary.

![](/images/docu/editor_attachments.png)

_Figure "Attachments": Add files to your note (left) | Re-check the attached files before sending them in (right)_

#### 2.2.1.4 Notification of other users

You can notify other users about your note inside of the note or you can address them directly. The users will be notified via E-Mail and Communote will show that they have been mentioned in a message.

There are again two ways of mentioning other users in a note: Firstly you can add the username of the user with a @-sign in front of it within the text of the note. Secondly you can use the "People"-function below the editor and type in the name of the person you would like to notify manually.

You can find out the username of the user by hovering the profile picture with the mouse and waiting a short time until the username shows up. Alternatively just start typing the name and Communote will suggest matching users automatically.

![](/images/docu/editor_users.png)

_Figure "Notification in the editor": via @-Sign or with the option "People"_

![](/images/docu/hovercard_user.png)

_Figure "Finding the abbreviation"_

If you would like to notify more than one person with one note, you don't have to notify everyone separately. You can simply address certain groups of users with a doubled @@-sign. All users belonging to that group will be notified about the message as it is sent. An overview of the supported groups and the users they comprise is outlined below:

| **@@all**  | All users with **reading rights** for the topic will be notified |
| ------------- |-----------------| --------------|
| **@@authors**      | All **authors (users with write access)** of a topic will be notified. As soon as a user has written one note/answer, he is counted as an author. |
| **@@managers**      | All **topic managers** will be notified. |
| **@@discussion** | All users that have **written an answer** in the discussion will be notified. _(This function is only available if the note is an answer!)_ |

_**Note:** Direct messages can only be sent to @@managers._

![](/images/docu/editor_mass_notification.png)

_Abbildung "Address certain groups of users"_

The standard configuration limits @@-mentions to 100 users. If one of the groups represents more than 100 users, the @@-function can not be used and the message won't be sent. You will receive an appropriate error message in that case. The limit which is configurable is helpful for larger companys to avoid excessive email traffic.

#### 2.2.1.5 Links

Within Communote you can also create Hyperlinks for your note. The easiest way to do so is the type in the URL of the internet address. Communote automatically identifies it as a link and transforms it. You can also mark specific words or a group of words as a link. Therefor you mark the words and choose "Insert link" in the editor options. You now type in the URL and the title in the new window and click "Insert" (see Figure "Insert Hyperlinks")

![](/images/docu/editor_links.png)

_Figure "Insert Hyperlinks"_

Furthermore it is possible to link messages with each other within Communote. All you need is the **permalink** of the note that you would like to link. The permalink is a permanent identifier of the note and can be found when "more" and "permalink" is chosen below the message. You don't need to click on that field, you can also simply copy the link to your clipboard (with a click of your right mouse button) and then insert it into your note.

#### 2.2.1.6 Emoticons

Communote supports a selection of the most common emoticons which will be automatically replaced with icons after the note was sent. An overview of the available smiley-codes with the associated icons is depicted in the next image.

![](/images/docu/smiley_cheatsheet.png)

_Figure "Emoticon Cheat sheet"_

#### 2.2.1.7 Autosave

As you are writing or editing a note, Communote automatically saves what is typed into the editor. You will then see a sign "Saved" with a date below the editor. If you need to take a break or your work has been interrupted, the last save will automatically be loaded into the editor as you open it again. You will then be able to see the message "Backup has been loaded" below the editor. You can also click "cancel" if you don't need the autosave anymore.

**Note:** Communote only saved one autosave per note. If you start a new note in another browser, the former backup will be overwritten.

![](/images/docu/editor_autosave.png)

_Figure "Automatic Backup of a Note"_

### 2.2.2 Comment and answer notes

If you have write access to a topic, you can answer to any message within that topic in order to give your colleagues feedback. The functionality of the answer-editor is identical to the editor for witing notes with one exception: The topic is already predefined and cannot be changed.

In order to write an answer, you can pass the specific note and then click "answer". The editor will now open and by default the author will be notified. You can send your note by clicking "send" or by using the shortage CTRL+Enter.

If you are watching the notes in discussion view _(Comments are shown directly below the note)_, there is a quick answer function with an easy input field and no format options right below the note. You can switch to the Rich Text Editor easily by clicking the arrows on the right hand's side of the quick editor.

![](/images/docu/editor_quickanswer.png)

_Figure "Create a quick answer"_

### 2.2.3 Edit notes

If you have made a mistake or if you have missed some important information, you can edit the notes after you have sent them (Figure "Edit notes"). In order to edit, you pass over the note and then choose the action "edit" which you will find under the option "more". The editor will now load automatically and you can edit the note. When you are finished, you can click "save" or use CTRL + Enter.

![](/images/docu/note_edit.png)

_Figure "Edit notes"_

### 2.2.4 Delete Notes

Furthermore you have the option to delete a note after it has been sent (Figure "Erase Notes"). You will find that function under "more" and "delete" below the text of the note.

**If you want to delete a note, the following conditions apply:**

*   You may delete a note, if you are the **author of that note**.
*   You may delete the note, as long as there is **no answer to it** yet.
*   You may delete notes from other users if you are the **manager of the topic.**
*   You may also delete discussions, if you are the **manager of the topic**.

![](/images/docu/note_delete.png)

_Figure "Erase Notes"_

### 2.2.5 Move Notes

A note or a discussion can be moved into another topic by the author or the manager of the topic using the function "move".

If you would like to move a note or discussion, the following conditions apply:

*   Only the entire discussion can be moved. Single answers cannot be moved.
*   You can only move a note or discussion into a topic where you have write access.

![](/images/docu/note_move.png)

_Figure "Move Notes"_

### 2.2.6 Writing notes via E-Mail

You can write new notes via E-Mail, without being logged into the Communote system. You only need to know the email address of the topic that you would like to write in and have a valid user account.

You can find the email address of the topic in the profile of the topic. In order to get there you choose a topic via "Select and Open" and then click onto "Info" in the horizontal navigation below the banner (Figure "Topic Information"). The email address will be shown in the information that is shown here. If there is no address to be found, the function may be disabled in your system.

Depending on the configuration of the system, a topic can have a unique email address or there may be only a systemwide address for all topics. In case there is only a systemwide address, you specify the topic in the reference headline.

![](/images/docu/topic_infos.png)

_Figure "Topic Information"_

If you would like to send in a note via e-mail, you need to use the address of your specific topic. Tags (#) and mentions (@) can be used the same way as the editor in the system. Attachments can also be integrated into the e-mail.

![](/images/docu/note_via_email.png)

_Figure "Send a note via e-mail"_

If you receive an email with a notification about a new note you can also use the answer function of your email programm. Communote will transfer your answer into a regular Communote note. Answer will remain within a discussion and the topic remains the same.

Important: Don't change the address or the subject headline of the email!

**If you would like to send a note from you mailaccount, the following conditions apply:**

*   You need to have a **valid user's account** for the communote system.
*   You need to write from the email address that is **connected to your Communote user's account**
*   The subject headline is import if there is only a systemwide mail address. If there is a specific address for your topic, the headline will not be in use.
*   If you want to answer to a note, you need to use the **reply function.** Otherwise there will be a new note, not an answer.

### 2.2.7 Direct Messages

Direct messages are private messages between two or more users. They are only visible to the author and the addressee(s) and can be written as a response to another note or as a new note, but it has to be marked as a direct message within the note and it must be addressed to one or more specific users.

Again there are two options for marking a note as a direct message. You can either mark it directly in the message by starting the note with a d (for direct message) followed by a space and then followed by the mentioning of the addressee (@user). If you are addressing more than one user, they must be separated by an empty space (Figure "Direct Messages"). The other way is again in the options: Below the input field of the users that you wold like to notify is a field "send as direct note". If you check that field, your message will be send as direct note.

![](/images/docu/editor_dm.png)

_Figure "Direct Messages": Mark a test as a direct message_

If you have write access to a topic, you can directly answer to the note. You can now either answer all addressee of the note or only a selection. It is not possible to include additional users in an answer to a direct message.

**If you would like to send a direkt message, the following conditions apply:**

*   A direct message can be edited and erased as long as there is no answer to it yet.
*   A direct message can be transformed into a "normal" message via editing.
*   It is on the other hand not possible to transform a "normal" message into a direct message.
*   @mentions within the note do not apply as addressee of the note.
*   Answers can only be send to all addressees of a direct message
*   addressees can be excluded when answering to a direct message.

## 2.3 Read Notes

### 2.3.1 Note view

Within the Communote system there are two different ways of viewing a message:

*   The stream view which shows all notes seperately in the order of their creation (see "View Modes" - right). You can always switch to the discussion view:
*   the discussion view shows a conversation (mother post and comments) as it appeared in one post (see Figure "View Modes" - left)

![](/images/docu/notes_views.png)

_Figure "View modes for notes": Discussion view (left) or Stream view (right)_

In order to switch between the views, you can choose the button above the note.

![](/images/docu/notes_change_view.png)

_Figure "Change view mode"_

### 2.3.2 Topic and People Overview

On the left hand's side of the interface you can find the tab "Topics" with all topics that you have access to. You can choose which topics you would like to follow. Two ways of viewing the topics are available: You can view only root topics (no subtopics) or you can view a complete list of all topics sorted in alphabetical order.

On the right hand's side you can additionally search for tags and topics.

![](/images/docu/topics.png)

_Figure "Topics and subtopics"_

You can switch between the views by clicking on the button on the right side above the topic list.

![](/images/docu/topics_change_view.png)

_Figure "View modes for topics": All or only root topics_

Next to the topic view you will find the tab "People". Here you can find all People that are registerted to your Communote in alphabetical order. Equal to the topic view you can also see which users you follow and add new users to follow. You can also search for tags within this view.

![](/images/docu/peoples.png)

_Figure "Overview Users"_

### 2.3.3 Organise Notes

#### 2.3.3.1 Bookmark a Note

In order to get a better overview of your Communote system and not to get important notes out of sight you can "bookmark" notes. Below the note, next to "answer" and "like" there is an option for "bookmarking" the note (Figure "Bookmark"). If you have chosen to bookmark the note, it will from now on appear in your tab "Bookmarks". You can remove notes from your bookmark list by clicking that option "bookmark" within the specific note for a second time. The note will no longer be part of your bookmark list.

![](/images/docu/note_bookmark.png)

_Figure "Bookmark"_

#### 2.3.3.2 "Follow" Notes

Another option for filtering Communote specifically for your interest is the "Following"-function. With its help you can directly follow specific activities within a topic. You can follow topics, tags and users. All notes that apply to your following-requirements will apear in your "Following"-Tab. You can activate new criteria in the topics and people overview or you just use the follow button inside the hovercards (Figure "Follow a person"). If you no longer want to follow a topic or person, you must click the follow-button again.

![](/images/docu/follow_user.png)

_Figure "Follow a person"_

#### 2.3.3.3 "Like" Notes

Additionally to following and bookmarking a note, you can also give quick feedback with the "like"-function with which you can show the other users that you liked that note. Just choose "like" (the thumb symbol) in the options below that note. You can now also see, who else likes the note.

![](/images/docu/note_like.png)

_Figure "Like a Note"_

#### 2.3.3.4 RSS & RTF

Above the list of notes you can find a knurl for further note-options. Here you can either do a RTF-export and convert the current note list into another type of document, that can be opened for example with MS Word. The RSS-Feed lets you subscribe to all changes within that topic via RSS-Feed.

![](/images/docu/notes_export.png)

_Figure "RTF and RSS"_

Depending on you RSS-Program, there may be differences in the way RSS-feeds can be subscribed to. Please make sure that your RSS-reader supports authentified feeds.

## 2.4 Manage topics

### 2.4.1 Topic localization

#### 2.4.1.1 Choose a topic | Filter topics

There are three different ways to choose a topic. The first way is to search for the name of topic at the "Choose & Open" search input at the top left corner of the interface. To click on a topic name at the meta information of a note is the second way. The last way is to go to the topics overview and choose your topic. If you have chosen a topic, the search function (see below) will now be applied to this topic. If you would like to change back to all notes, just go to the notes overview at the sidebar.

![](/images/docu/topic_chosen.png)

_Figure "Choose a topic"_

#### 2.4.1.2 My favorites

If you have topics that you frequently read or write in, you can save them as a favorite in order to make them available more easily in the future. If you open the topic that you would like to choose as a favorite, you can "pin" it to the list of favorites.

If there are new notes in one of your favorite topics, you will be notified. You can erase a topic from your favorites by clicking the "X" next to the name of the topic.

![](/images/docu/sidebar_pin_favorites.png)

_Figure "Pin topics as favorites"_

### 2.4.2 Coordinate Topics

#### 2.4.2.1 Create and edit topics

You can create a new topic in the topic overview. Choose the plus-sign that is included in the first position of the overview (Figure "Create a topic") and a new window will appear that lets you specify the topic details (Figure "Specify topic details"). After creating a new topic, you will automatically be the topic manager.

![](/images/docu/topics_new.png)

_Figure "Create a topic"_

![](/images/docu/topic_create.png)

_Figure "Specify topic details"_

You as the new topic manager can specify the topic title or alias and you can see and edit the topic details. You can also apply a protocoll that will make all changes in access rights a systemwide note. Please note, that this system note can not be erased. In the topic details, you also have the possibility of erasing the topic.

After creating a topic, it will appear in the topic overview page and can be found with the search functin. If you would like to apply changes, you can choose the tab "info" and then "edit topic" (Figure "Topic Information").

Here you can also change the topic picture (for the overview page), the banner, access rights and the topic structure. Additionally you can also invite new users in this function.

![](/images/docu/topic_edit.png)

_Figure "Edit Topic"_

To connect different topics with each other hierarchically, you can define subtopics. Therefor you have to click on "Topic Structure" in your topic settings. In the next step you can assign subtopics to your topic by typing in their names into the search field.

![](/images/docu/topic_subtopics.png)

_Figure "Define Subtopics"_

As the creator of the topic you are automatically assigned as the topic manager of the topic. You can assign new topic manager to the topic and assign other access rights to the users. While typing in the name, Communote will automatically suggest users to you. You can now pick "manage", "read" and "write" as access rights. If you assign "manage" to a user, he will now have the same rights as you. You can also edit access rights with a click on right and erase the user by clicking "erase".

![](/images/docu/topic_access.png)

_Figure "Access Rights"_

Additionally you can invite new users. You therefor choose the tab in the topic manager and type in the name and abbreviation of the user and suggest a language and access right to him. The abbreviation can not be changed afterwards. If you now choose "invite user", the new user will receive an e-mail that informs him about the topic and the access rights that have been given to him.

![](/images/docu/topic_invite.png)

_Figure "Invite Users"_

## 2.5 Search Functions and Filters

If you are looking for a specific message, Communote supplies an extensive search function in order for you to find it.

You can filter for a specific note by text, tag, author and topic. Only one click onto the tag or user filters Communote for that tag or person. You can also choose a search tag directly from a note or you can pick a tag from the tag cloud on the right side of the interface. You can also type in the tag you are looking for there. Below the search field there will now appear the filtered tags and users. By clicking on the words for a second time, you can erase them.

Note: The different filters can be combined with each other. The more filters you apply, the fewer search results you will get.

#### 2.5.1 Context Search

If you are searching for a specific note content, you can search for that content in the search field without user using the other search functions. Just type in the keywod you are looking for and press "Enter". You will now be proposed possible tags that you can choose directly from. If none of those tags apply to your search phrase, just keep on typing in the correct phrase.

![](/images/docu/search_context.png)

_Figure "Context Search"_

#### 2.5.2 Tagcloud

The tag cloud supplies you with an overview of the tags that are frequently used in the microblog. The bigger the tag is in the tag cloud, the more it is used in the microblog. If you choose a tag from the tagcloud, you will be guided to a filtered search.

![](/images/docu/filter_tags.png)

_Figure "Tagcloud"_

#### 2.5.3 Author filter

With the user filter you can search for notes that have been written by a specific author. You will receive an overview of all users that have write access to the topic you're looking at and can select an author by clicking on their profile picture. You will be able to see the username abbreviation when you pass your mouse over their profile picture.

![](/images/docu/filter_users.png)

_Figure "Author filter"_

#### 2.5.4 Content Filter

The content filter is useful if you are looking for a specific format of a note or an attachment. You can directly choose what the note you are looking for is supposed to contain: A picture, document, link activity or a video? If you choose one of those contents, only notes will appear that contain that specific content.

![](/images/docu/filter_content.png)

_Figure "Content Filter"_

#### 2.5.5 Period Filter

You can also choose a period of time in which you note was written. The quick launch will let you choose the last week and the last month, but you can also choose a very specific period of time in the mask. Therefor a small calender will appear in which you can pick the right period of time. The arrows on top let you jump between the months.

![](/images/docu/filter_period.png)

_Figure "Filter for a period of time"_

## 2.6 Profile-Options

As you are choosing "YourName" in the top menu bar and then click "edit profile", you can change profile details like your company, phone number and tags

![](/images/docu/user_edit.png)

_Figure "My Profile"_

You can also change your profile picture if you choose "Profile Picture and Banner" and then "Choose a file" and choose the correct file for your profile picture on your computer. Now you can set the area of the picture that you would like to use. If you choose "Upload Profile Picture", the picture will automatically be linked to your profile. If you would like to use the default picture again, choose "use default" and your profile picture will be erased.

![](/images/docu/profile_picture_helper.png)

_Figure "Adjust profile picture"_

The process for adjusting the banner is very similar: You can also find it in the are "Profile picture and banner". For the banner it is important that it has the correct size of 960px*100px in order for to be shown correctly.

"Notification" lets you adjust your notification options. You therefor need to make sure that the email address that you have received your first Communote email from is listed as a "secure address". Otherwise your notifications will be put into the Spam-Folder of your inbox.

You can be notified about the following options:

*   mentions - You will be notified if there is a note in which you have been mentioned with @YourName (former standard)
*   Discussions you took part in - You will be notiffied if there is a new answer in a discussion that you have been part in, meaning have written at least one answer
*   When someone "likes" a note of yours

Additionally you have the option to change you email address and to set a new password. The bar on top of the password inbox, how secure your password is. If you would like to erase your account, you can also do that here. Depending on your system, you may be able to choose between erasing all your data and notes and erasing your account without erasing your notes.

## 2.7  Embed Communote

It is possible to embed streams of Communote topics into any website. Therefor you have to copy and paste a special embed code (a JavaScript snippet) into the HTML code of your website.
Even in embedded topic streams you can write, comment and like messages - as easy as you already know it from the regular Communote. The embed code can be reached from the actions menu of the stream.

![](/images/docu/embed_option.png)

_Figure "Embed option"_
