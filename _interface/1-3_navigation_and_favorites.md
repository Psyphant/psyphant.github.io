## 1.3 Navigation and Favorites on the left sidebar

On the left hand side of your screen you can choose in which topic you would like to act. When you choose "Notes" you will be guided to an overview of all messages in the system that you are able to see. This is also the welcome screen that you were brought to when you logged into Communote.

"Topics" and "Persons" shows a display of all (visible to you) topics and users in the system. You can search within this overview page to look at the Topics or users. You can also search for a specific user or topic by starting to type in the "Choose and open" field. Most of the time it is enough to type the first letters and the system will suggest a specific user or topic for you (see figure "Sidebar").
